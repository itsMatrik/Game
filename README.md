Weeeeeell, where to start...

A week ago, on October 8, we were asked to do a school project.It supposed to be a game on theme "energy-saving".There were 3 of us, we won the school programming Olympiad,we all wrote in different languages,we had zero experience working in a team and we had no idea what kind of game it would be at all.The dream team! Oh, and also, we were given a deadline of one week.We spent two days trying to find a language with each other and understand what this game would look like.We stopped at the fact that we will make the game on the godot engine.I had no idea what it was, but the idea seemed cool to me, so we started making a game, and I studied this engine in parallel.We finished the project on Friday.And that's when I realized that this game is completely different from what we originally intended.As it turned out, one of the people from the team had almost no programming skills at all, and the second knew only python and the very basics of godot engine, and me, who had to learn a new engine in 2 days.Then I realized that I had to take the initiative into my own hands.And what can I do best?That's right, web-sites.And I started thinking.

Creating a game.
		
As it turned out, we moved the deadline to Monday, so I had only 2 days to create a game.Needless to say, these 2 days I did not get out of the IDE.
I came up with the idea of the game on the go, so I didn't even know my game need to look like.In the process, I gained a lot of new knowledge and skills.I've perfected react hooks, especially useEffect, because the whole game is built on it.Finally, in practice, I realized how the multi-page reaction works, its main feature.I even used the DALL-E3 neural network to generate images for the game, because it's all made in pixel style.I also learned how to make movable elements, for example through the keys.And most importantly - I studied the new library - react dnd.Since a lot of elements of my game are built on this mechanics.

Overall, I am insanely proud of this project.Not its complexity, becaseu it's a very easy project.I am proud that in 2 days I learned so many cool things and features and made my first game.I didn't even bother to write such a detailed README, although no one will even read it xd.In any case, thank you, the person who took the time to read this whole story.
